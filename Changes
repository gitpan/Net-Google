Revision history for Perl extension Net::Google.

0.51	 Sat Oct 26 2002

	 - Updated ::Search.pm to watch '__endIndex' key and have it take 
	   precedence over max_results method if the former is less than 
	   the latter. (Props to Bjoern Hoehrmann for the fix.)

	 - Added return_estimatedTotal() method to do the same thing but
	   comparing against '__estimatedTotalResultsCount'

	 - Replaced test.pl with t/*.t files

	 - Updated POD

0.5	 Wed May 03 2002
	 
	 - Contributed patch by Marc Hedlund <marc@precipice.org>.
	   Thanks!

	 - Put single quotes around all $VERSION numbers in order to
           match MakeMaker's expected format (see ExtUtils::MakeMaker
           perldoc, Using Attributes and Parameters: VERSION_FROM).
           Fixes make install errors with perl-5.6.1.

	 - Created a new Net::Google::Response object to hold more
           information from the search response.

	 - Updated Net::Google::Search to use Net::Google::Response.

	 - Added Net::Google::Search::_state and introduced some degree
	   of memoization to response/result objects

	 - Moved most of the code in Net::Google::Search::results into
	   Net::Google::Search::response

	 - Updated test.pl to be a bit more verbose (Thanks to Lee Goddard 
	   and the CPAN-testers.)

	 - Updated POD
