Revision history for Perl extension Net::Google.

0.52	 Sat Nov 02 2002

	 - Removed old code from ::Google.pm (duh)

	 - Updated POD

0.52_1	 Fri Nov 01 2002

	 - Added Net::Google::Service, which isn't anything new but
	   just an abstracting of the code to return SOAP widgets

	 - Added leading '&' to constants so that they'll play nicely
	   with Perl 5.005_02 (see note in ::Service.pm - props to 
	   Martin Ebert for pointing this out.)

	 - Updated to use CPAN::MakeMaker

	 - Fussed with .t files (mostly just so that they work correctly
	   when I call them from the command line)

	 - Updated POD

0.51	 Sat Oct 26 2002

	 - Updated ::Search.pm to watch '__endIndex' key and have it take 
	   precedence over max_results method if the former is less than 
	   the latter. (Props to Bjoern Hoehrmann for the fix.)

	 - Added return_estimatedTotal() method to do the same thing but
	   comparing against '__estimatedTotalResultsCount'

	 - Replaced test.pl with t/*.t files

	 - Updated POD

0.5	 Wed May 03 2002
	 
	 - Contributed patch by Marc Hedlund <marc@precipice.org>.
	   Thanks!

	 - Put single quotes around all $VERSION numbers in order to
           match MakeMaker's expected format (see ExtUtils::MakeMaker
           perldoc, Using Attributes and Parameters: VERSION_FROM).
           Fixes make install errors with perl-5.6.1.

	 - Created a new Net::Google::Response object to hold more
           information from the search response.

	 - Updated Net::Google::Search to use Net::Google::Response.

	 - Added Net::Google::Search::_state and introduced some degree
	   of memoization to response/result objects

	 - Moved most of the code in Net::Google::Search::results into
	   Net::Google::Search::response

	 - Updated test.pl to be a bit more verbose (Thanks to Lee Goddard 
	   and the CPAN-testers.)

	 - Updated POD
	 
0.4.2	 Wed Apr 17 2002

	 - No changes to actual codebase. Fixed errors in MANIFEST
